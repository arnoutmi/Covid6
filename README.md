## About this project
This project creates a Streamlit-dashboard that displays filtered data from databases in interactive charts. It helps users gain insights quickly and perform anlyses. 

The project filters the data from a database by handling missing and duplicate values. Based on the filtered data, visualisations are generated. Code conversion throught Streamlit creates the interactive dashboard that can be used by users (not necessarily contributers to the project).

The code of this project can handle very large databases and show large amounts of data in a clear way using visualisations. We can adjust how we want to handle missing and duplicate values based on what kind of data is in de database. The generated dashboard provides the users of our project with an opportunity to analyse big databases in a very simple manner. Using the dashboard, users can easily navigate through the data, perform various anaylses, and gain new insights in their research without having to apply methods to the data to make it more readible (because the project handles that).

## How to use the project
### Installations
This project uses some libraries and packages in python that have to be installed before you can run it. 
- **Python 3.x**
- **Streamlit**
- **Pandas**
- **Matplotlib / Plotly**
- **SQL connector**

### Get started
- **Clone the repository**
- **Install the required libraries and packages**
- **Run the Streamlit dashboard**

## Contributors
This project consisted of various phases. 

Phase 1 was mostly adding the databases in our repository and handling the missing and duplicate values. Handling these values can be done in various ways and all methods were explored and written. Using trial and error we have selected the best methods to handle these value types in our opinion.   
Phase 2 consisted of writing methods that took dataframes and convert that data into several chart types.   
Phase 3 contained introducing queries to select different parts of the data en then assigning that data to a dataframe and testing these dataframes with the methods written in Phase 2.  
Phase 4 creating the actual dashboard so that the charts are interactive and the dashboard is easy to navigate through for the users.  
Phase 5 consisted of the finishing touches, writing the README file, fixing the last errors, and making sure everything runs smoothly.
